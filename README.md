# Digital Instruments in Max

## Authors
Cassie Tarakajian, Ashley Bellouin 

## Before we start...
- What is a musical instrument?
- Who makes music instruments?
- What are some barriers to creating music?
- What is the most recently invented instrument?

## Introduction
This workshop will focus on using Max software to create custom digital musical instruments. Starting from a beginners standpoint, we will introduce Max and cover the basics of the software, then focus on creating experimental sounds by manipulating provided field recordings and/or student’s own audio recordings. Some processing techniques that will be covered are delay, feedback, and filtering, as well as how to create a simple vocoder and sequencer. We will also show how to interact with these programs using external devices with a simple interface. At the end of the workshop, students should understand how to create their own digital musical instruments that can be played by anyone using an external device. By creating a final interface that is simple to understand and interact with, these digital instruments become accessible to the vast majority of people. No musical or programming knowledge is required to create sound. In general, classical musical instruments have complex designs that can be intimidating to approach, require certain physicality to use, and take years of practice to understand. The end goal of this workshop is to create a musical instrument that anyone can play through a few simple button presses.

Approximately 3 hours will be spent learning the software and various audio techniques. The last hour will be dedicated to open lab time where students can work on their own projects, using the tools they just learned.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
High school students, ages 14+

### Outcomes & Goals
Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of digital audio and how to build a few different types of digital instruments. They will also learn about different types of musical interfaces.

## Exercise Descriptions
* Free Play - Play with the instruments we made in class and experiment with all of the different types of sounds you can make. Write down what you did. Try to string some of these actions together into something you like, or something you think is fun.

## Student Reflections, Takeaways and Next Steps
Additional materials for the students to leave with that can help them dig deeper into the subject or additional exercises and challenges to help students progress their knowledge to the next leve and gain mastery of the subject through independent study.
* Multiple Project Exit Points: an idea of high-medium-low projects so students are locked into one end product.
  * First Steps - a simple exercise
  * Next Steps - medium exercise
  * Big Steps - a challenge or open ended study
* Presentation: how might students share their work? With peers, outside world? What media or platforms could/should be referenced to students to encourage sharing (instagram, tumblr...)? 
* Reflection: reflection questions that ask students to think about CS concepts and practices. How can students express what they’ve learned in some creative way?
