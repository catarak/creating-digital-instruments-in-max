# Creating Digital Instruments in Max

## Authors
Cassie Tarakajian, Ashley Bellouin 

## Before we start...
- What is a musical instrument?
- Who makes music instruments?
- What are some barriers to creating music?
- What is the most recently invented instrument?

## Introduction
This workshop will focus on using Max software to create custom digital musical instruments. Starting from a beginners standpoint, we will introduce Max and cover the basics of the software, then focus on creating experimental sounds by manipulating provided field recordings and/or student’s own audio recordings. Some processing techniques that will be covered are delay, feedback, and filtering, as well as how to create a simple vocoder and sequencer. We will also show how to interact with these programs through a simple, custom interface. At the end of the workshop, students should understand how to create their own digital musical instruments that can be played by anyone. By creating a final interface that is simple to understand and interact with, these digital instruments become accessible to the vast majority of people. No musical or programming knowledge is required to create sound. In general, classical musical instruments have complex designs that can be intimidating to approach, require certain physicality to use, and take years of practice to understand. The end goal of this workshop is to create a musical instrument that anyone can play through a few simple button presses.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
High school students, ages 14+. No prerequisites required. Please have Max 8 and Audacity installed on your machine before the start of class. 

### Outcomes & Goals
In this workshop we will be creating custom digital musical instruments using Max software and field recordings. Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of digital audio and how to build a few different types of digital instruments. They will also learn about different types of musical interfaces.

### Pacing / Duration
4 hours total
#### Part 1: 2 hours
* ~30 min - Introduction to Workshop. 
  * What is a musical instrument? 
  * What is Max and what can you do with it? Show example works.
  * Get aquainted with the Max interface
* ~50 min - The basics of manipulating a sound 
  * How to play back a sound file
  * Adjust speed, switch between files
  * Feedback
  * Delay
  * Filtering 
  * Presets 
* ~10 min - Break
* ~30 min - Recording with Audacity & Group Projects 
  * You can create your own sound files with Audacity 
  * Working in groups of 2, make a patch that expands upon the techniques we just learned. You can either use a provided sound file, or make your own. 
  
#### Part 2: 2 hours
* ~50 min - Further explorations in how to manipulate a sound  
  * Vocoder 
  * Sequencer 
* ~30 min - Integrate a controller/Create custom interface
  * Look at examples of different musical interfaces.
  * What are different ways you can trigger or control your patch? 
   * Trigger events through audio input 
   * Use your keyboard as a controller
  * Presentation mode 
* ~10 min - Break
* ~30 min - Group Projects & Free Play 
  * Working in groups of 2, make a patch that incorporates techniques from the first and second parts of the workshop. Control some aspect of your patch with either audio input or your keyboard, and create a user interface in presentation mode that anyone can understand. 

## Materials Needed & Exercises To Do Before Class
### Software to download ahead of time
* [Max 8](https://cycling74.com/products/max-features) from Cycling '74
* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

### Materials and Resources
* [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)

### Vocabulary
* DAW (Digital Audio Workstation): Software used for recording, editing, and producing audio files
* Patch: This refers to the programs that you create in Max.
* Digital Instrument: an instrument composed of hardware, software, and a user interface.
* Audio Effect: a way to change the characteristics of a sound. 
* Vocoder: a synthesizer that produces sounds from an analysis of audio input. This was originally used for a voice effect. 
* Sequencer: a system for outputting events (sounds) at specified intervals.
* Field Recordings: an audio recording produced outside a recording studio. 
* Delay: an audio effect that records an input signal, then plays it back after a period of time.
* Feedback: A signal chain where the output of a signal is fed back into it's input. 
* Filtering: an audio effect that heightens or lowers certain frequencies in a sound. 
* Program: A procedure, or set of instructions, that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. 
* Programming Language: The human-readable commands and syntax (or grammar rules) used to write programs. 
* Graphical Programming Language: A programming language in which users create programs by manipulating elements using a GUI (graphical user interface) rather than using text.

## Exercise Descriptions
* Free Play - Play with the instruments we made in class and experiment with all of the different types of sounds you can make. Write down what you did. Try to string some of these actions together into something you like, or something you think is fun.

## Student Reflections, Takeaways and Next Steps
Additional materials for the students to leave with that can help them dig deeper into the subject or additional exercises and challenges to help students progress their knowledge to the next leve and gain mastery of the subject through independent study.
* Multiple Project Exit Points: an idea of high-medium-low projects so students are locked into one end product.
  * First Steps - a simple exercise
  * Next Steps - medium exercise
  * Big Steps - a challenge or open ended study
* Presentation: how might students share their work? With peers, outside world? What media or platforms could/should be referenced to students to encourage sharing (instagram, tumblr...)? 
* Reflection: reflection questions that ask students to think about CS concepts and practices. How can students express what they’ve learned in some creative way?
